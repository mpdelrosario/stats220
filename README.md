## Favourite movies and books

**ðŸŽ¬ Here's my top 3 movies of 2023:**

1. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
2. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. III
3. Dungeons and Dragons: Honour Among Theives

**NOTE:** no I'm not actually 12 years old (well... maybe only mentally), I'm just a sucker for entertaining, well-written cinematic stories starring a hero with a new-found family okay?
